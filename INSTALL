Prerequisites
-------------

This package requires Python 2.6 or later.  The MPFR and GMP libraries will
need to be already installed on your system.


Installation
------------

Instructions for installation from a distribution tarball.  We'll
assume that you've downloaded a tarball whose name is something like
"bigfloat-0.3.0a2.tar.gz".  The exact version number may differ; just
substitute the real version number everywhere that "0.3.0a2" appears in
what follows.

(1) Unpack the tarball with something like:

  tar -zxvf bigfloat-0.3.0a2.tar.gz

This should create a directory bigfloat-0.3.0a2/ containing a setup.py
script and the rest of the bigfloat source.

(2) Enter the created directory, and execute the command

  python setup.py install

from the bigfloat-0.3.0a2/ directory.  For a site-wide installation, you may need
to become superuser, or use the 'sudo' command.  You can also build and
install in two separate steps:

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

For this to work, the MPFR and GMP libraries must already be installed on your
system (complete with any necessary header files: on Linux, look for a packages
called 'mpfr-devel' and 'gmp-devel').  If the libraries or include files are
found in an unusual place, you may need to modify environment variables so that
the setup command can find the necessary header files.

An example: on Mac OS X, using the system Python, but with MPFR and GMP
installed in /opt/local (e.g., by MacPorts), one can do:

    LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib CPATH=/opt/local/include python setup.py build

Alternatively, the include and library directories can be supplied to the build_ext command:

    python setup.py build_ext -I /opt/local/include -L/opt/local/lib

(3) (Optional).  Test the installation by doing:

  python -m bigfloat.test.test_bigfloat

If installation was successful, the bigfloat-0.3.0a2/ directory that you
created can now be deleted.
