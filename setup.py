DESCRIPTION = """\
Arbitrary precision correctly-rounded floating point arithmetic, via MPFR.\
"""

LONG_DESCRIPTION = """\
The ``bigfloat`` package is a Python package providing arbitrary-precision
correctly-rounded binary floating-point arithmetic.  It is currently
implemented as a Python extension module (generated using Cython) around the
MPFR library (http://www.mpfr.org).

Features
--------

- correct rounding on all operations;  precisely defined semantics
  compatible with the IEEE 754-2008 standard.

- support for mixed-type operations with Python integers and floats

- support for emulating IEEE 754 arithmetic in any of the IEEE binary
  interchange formats described in IEEE 754-2008.  Infinities, NaNs,
  signed zeros, and subnormals are all supported.

- easy control of rounding modes and precisions, via Python's 'with'
  statement.

A quick tour
------------

The ``bigfloat`` module is small and simple to use.  Here's a quick
tour of some of its features.  See the `full tutorial and reference
documentation <http://packages.python.org/bigfloat/>`_ for more
details.

For demonstration purposes, start with::

    >>> from bigfloat import *

Note that this import shadows some builtin Python functions, namely
``abs``, ``max``, ``min`` and ``pow``.  In normal usage you'll
probably only want to import the classes and functions that you
actually need.

The main class is the ``BigFloat`` class::

    >>> BigFloat(1)  # can be constructed from an integer, float or string
    BigFloat.exact('1.0000000000000000', precision=53)
    >>> BigFloat('3.14159') ** 2 / 6.0  # can combine with ints and floats
    BigFloat.exact('1.6449312880166664', precision=53)
    >>> BigFloat('0.1', precision(200)) # high-precision value from string
    BigFloat.exact('0.1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    0000000002', precision=200)


Newly-created ``BigFloat`` instances refer to the current *context* to
determine what precision and rounding modes to use.  This current
context is represented by a ``Context`` instance, and can be retrieved
by calling ``getcontext``::

    >>> getcontext()
    Context(precision=53, emax=1073741823, emin=-1073741823,
            subnormalize=False, rounding=ROUND_TIES_TO_EVEN)

The ``precision(200)`` argument passed to the ``BigFloat`` constructor
above is also an example of a ``Context``::

    >>> precision(200)
    Context(precision=200)

The context used for a calculation can be set using the ``setcontext``
function, but a better way to make a temporary change to the context
is to use Python's ``with`` statement::

    >>> with precision(1000):
    ...     print sqrt(2)
    ...
    1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967187537694807317667973
    7990732478462107038850387534327641572735013846230912297024924836
    0558507372126441214970999358314132226659275055927557999505011527
    8206057147010955997160597027453459686201472851741864088919860955
    232923048430871432145083976260362799525140798964

Here, ``sqrt`` is one of a number of mathematical functions that the
``bigfloat`` module exports.  As you can see, these functions operate on
integers and floats as well as ``BigFloat`` instances, but always
return a ``BigFloat`` instance.

Rounding modes can be controlled similarly.  Here are upper and lower
bounds for Ï€, accurate to 53 significant bits::

    >>> with RoundTowardPositive:
    ...     const_pi()
    ...
    BigFloat.exact('3.1415926535897936', precision=53)
    >>> with RoundTowardNegative:
    ...     const_pi()
    ...
    BigFloat.exact('3.1415926535897931', precision=53)

And as you'd expect, ``with`` statements like those above can be
nested.  ``Context`` objects can also be combined using addition::

    >>> with RoundTowardPositive + precision(24):
    ...     BigFloat(1) / 3
    ...
    BigFloat.exact('0.333333343', precision=24)

Various ``Context`` objects corresponding to IEEE 754 interchange
formats are predefined::

    >>> quadruple_precision
    Context(precision=113, emax=16384, emin=-16493, subnormalize=True)
    >>> half_precision
    Context(precision=11, emax=16, emin=-23, subnormalize=True)
    >>> with half_precision:
            log(2)
    ...
    BigFloat.exact('0.69336', precision=11)
