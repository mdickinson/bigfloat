# Computing the gamma function via Lanczos' formula

# for more.  Note that the formula for a_0 on that page is invalid, involving
# a (-1)!.  But in general, the j=0 term of the sum for a_k is
# (k-1)!/(k)! = 1/k, and multiplying by k gives 0.

# The reference
#
# http://my.fit.edu/~gabdo/gamma.txt  (Paul Godfrey) gives instead
# the formulas:
#
# z! = sqrt(2*pi)*(z+g+1/2)^(z+1/2)*exp(-(z+g+1/2))*Ag(z)

# Ag(z) = 1/2*p(0) + z/(z+1)*p(1) + z*(z-1)/(z+1)/(z+2)*p(2) + ...

# p(k) = sum_{j=0}^k C(2k, 2j)*F(g, j)

# C(2k, 2j) : coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials of the
# first kind.  (1, x, 2x^2-1, 4x^3-3x, ...).  Thus:
#
# C(0, 0) = 1
# C(2, 0) = -1, C(2, 2) = 2
# C(4, 0) = 1, C(4, 2) = -8, C(4, 4) = 8

# sequence A053120.
#
# if C(n, m) = coefficient of x**m in nth poly, then
#   C(n, 0) = (-1)**(n/2)   (n even)
#   C(n, m) = (-1)**((n+m)/2 + m) * (2**(m-1))*n*binomial((n+m)/2-1, m-1)/m

# Hence:
#
#  C(2k, 2j) = (-1)**(j+k) 2**(2j-1) 2k binomial(k+j-1, 2j-1) / (2j)
#            = (-1)**(j+k) 2**2j (k+j-1)! / (2j)! / (k-j)! * k
# absorbing the (2j)!/j!/2**(2j) from F(g, j) gives:
#            = (-1)**(j+k) (k+j-1)! * k / (k-j)! / j!

# Okay, so that works in


# F(g, j) = sqrt(2)/pi * (j-1/2)!*(j+g+1/2)^-(j+1/2)*exp(j+g+1/2)

# note that (j-1/2)! = (j-1/2)*(j-3/2)*...*(1/2) * sqrt(pi)
# = (2*j-1)*(2*j-3)*...*2 * sqrt(pi) / 2**j
# = (2*j)!/j!/2**(2j) * sqrt(pi)
