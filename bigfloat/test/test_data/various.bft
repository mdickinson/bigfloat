# The following tests are not supposed to be exhaustive tests of the behaviour
# of the individual functions; that job is left to the MPFR test suite.
# Instead, they're supposed to exercise the functions to catch simple errors
# like mismatches in wrapping.  So we only need to check one or two
# characteristic values per function.  The test values below were computed
# using independent sources (mainly Pari/GP).
